# **A Machine Learning Approach for Studying Galaxy Kinematics with ALMA in Preparation for the SKA**

## **Using a convolutional autoencoder to return the level of ordered rotation of a galaxy**

Using the pre-trained [convolutional autoencoder](https://github.com/SpaceMeerkat/CAE/blob/master/Kinematics_Tester_Files/CAE_Epoch_300.pt), users can quickly output the latent positions of galaxies and recover the following information:

1. The circularity- defined as the amount of kinetic enrgy invested in flat circular rotation of a galaxy and thus the degree of kinematic disorder.

2. The galaxy position angle with an uncertainty of ~20% (dependant on the inclination).
